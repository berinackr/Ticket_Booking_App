## Screens Details

The `HomeScreen` class creates the home screen. This screen starts with a personal good morning message and offers the opportunity to specify tickets and accommodation by listing current or upcoming flights and accommodation. The home screen includes the continuum of searching and browsing activities using FluentUI icons.

The `SearchScreen` class creates the screen where the user can search. This screen allows the user to search for flights or hotels. It also provides information about special offers and upcoming flights.

The `TicketScreen` class represents a screen that displays the user's tickets. This screen lists the user's upcoming or previous tickets and shows the details of each ticket.

The `ProfileScreen` class represents a screen that displays the user's profile retrieval and rewards. This screen includes information such as the user's profile picture, name, location, and premium status. It also shows users' earned rewards and accumulated miles.
